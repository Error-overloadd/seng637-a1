# Introduction

In this lab, we worked with an ATM simulation system and tested its main functions. We ran the system and performed different types of transactions, and observed how it worked in both normal and error scenarios.

During the lab, we used exploratory testing to freely explore the system and find unexpected issues or bugs. We also used manual functional testing with predefined test cases from Appendix C to check whether the system worked as expected. After that, we performed regression testing on the newer version 1.1 of the system to see whether previously reported defects were fixed. 

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

For exploratory testing, we interacted with the system without using any specific test cases. We focused on becoming familiar with the system and observing how it responded to different user actions.

We tested the main ATM functions, such as system startup, card insertion, PIN entry, withdrawals, deposits, transfers, and balance inquiries. We also tested error and edge cases, such as entering invalid inputs, cancelling transactions at different stages, and attempting transactions with insufficient account balances.

During testing, we adjusted our testing paths based on the system’s behavior. This allowed us to explore different scenarios and identify potential issues that were not covered by the manual testing use cases.

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

In this lab, we used both exploratory testing and manual functional testing to test the ATM system. Although both methods involved manually interacting with the system, we used them in different ways.

During exploratory testing, we interacted with the system freely without following predefined test cases. This helped us understand the overall workflow of the ATM system and observe how it responded to different user actions. We were also able to notice unexpected behaviors and edge cases that were not explicitly covered by test cases.

For manual functional testing, we followed the predefined test cases provided in Appendix C. This approach was more structured and focused on checking whether specific system functions worked as expected. Because the test cases clearly defined the inputs and expected outputs, we found this method to be more consistent and repeatable.

Overall, we found exploratory testing to be more flexible and useful for discovering unexpected issues, while manual functional testing was more effective for systematically verifying the system’s required functionality.

# Notes and discussion of the peer reviews of defect reports

In our group, we used Excel as our issue tracking system. Defect reports were recorded in the spreadsheet and reviewed by group members together. The defect reports were shared within the group and discussed during the peer review process. 

During the review, we checked whether the reproduction steps, initial system state, and expected results were clearly described. We discussed whether the information provided was detailed enough for another person to understand and reproduce the defect. When parts of a defect report were unclear or incomplete, we updated the description to improve clarity.

After regression testing was performed on version 1.1 of the system, we reviewed the defect reports again and updated their statuses based on the results. Defects that no longer existed were marked as resolved, while defects that still existed were updated with additional notes. 


# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 

For this lab, we used pair testing when testing the ATM system. During each testing session, one group member operated the system and performed the testing steps, while the other member observed the system behavior and took notes on any issues found.

We switched roles during testing so that everyone had a chance to both run the system and review the results. While testing, we discussed what we observed to make sure we understood the system behavior correctly and did not miss any issues.

After testing was finished, all defects found by different pairs were combined into the shared issue tracking spreadsheet. Based on the collected testing results and defect reports, we worked together to complete the lab report.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

One difficulty we faced during this lab was getting familiar with the ATM system at the beginning. The system included multiple screens and steps, and some actions depended on previous inputs. Because of this, it took some time to understand how the system flowed from one step to another and how different transactions were handled.

Another challenge was writing clear and detailed defect reports. At first, some defect reports did not include enough information, such as the exact system state or complete steps to reproduce the issue. After reviewing the defect reports with group members, we discussed what information was missing and updated the descriptions to make them clearer and easier to follow.

Through this lab, we learned that using different testing methods is helpful. Exploratory testing helped us quickly understand how the system worked and find unexpected issues, while manual functional testing helped us check whether the system behavior matched the expected results. We also learned that clear defect descriptions are important for effective defect tracking and review.

# Comments/feedback on the lab and lab document itself

Overall, the lab was useful for understanding basic software testing concepts and defect tracking for us. The steps in the lab document were clear and easy to follow, which made it easier to complete the required testing tasks.

Our team felt the ATM system provided a good example for practicing different testing methods. Using both exploratory testing and manual functional testing helped us better understand how different approaches can be applied to the same system. The provided test cases in Appendix C were helpful for guiding the manual testing process.

We have one suggestion for improvement which is to include more examples of defect reports, especially for exploratory testing. This could help students better understand the expected level of detail when reporting defects.
